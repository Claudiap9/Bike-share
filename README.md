# Cyclistic Bike-share Analysis Case Study 
For the final step of the Google Analytics Certifiation, I will be recording my Capstone Project to showcase the skills I have learned. In the case study, I am a Junior Analyst working for a company Cyclistic, a bike share company in Chicago. The team want to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
GOAL: Design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual memberships.

About the Company:
- 5,824 bicycles and 692 stations
- Pricing plans: Single-ride pass, Full-day pass, and annual memberships
- annual memberships are more profitable than casual memberships

The director of Marketing Moreno, provided three question to guide the future marketing program. 
**1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Moreno has assigned the first question.

## Insights

<img width="1022" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ac7991f-68a0-4f05-99dc-1e04004bccbe">


Implications
- Casual riders likely ride for long durations as they are using single-ride passes and are seen more on weekends as leisurely rides
- Members have consistent ride time average, likely that bike-share is used to commute to work
- Summer Season, with more outdoor activity, is when bike shares are more popular
- Summer Season rides consist of 41.8% of Casual Riders (nearly half) and the company should take advantage of the high exposure to the app and high demand in Casual riders to their advantage ( eg. convert to Annual Members)

Recommendations
- Launch Promotions for Annual Membership during the beginning of Summer season (Weekends are prime time to promote to casual riders)
- Create Summer Membership passes (can be priced a little more per month than Annual Memberships) to attract those who want to ride during vacation period

Additional Data that could Expand My Findings
- User ID: Could help find user behaviour, switching from casual to membership, etc.
- Single-pass or Full-day Pass: Popularity of pass, can help understand casual riders
- Age Group: To understand the user and make implications about occasion for ride
