# Cyclistic Bike-share analysis case study 
For the final step of the Google Analytics Certifiation, I will be recording my Capstone Project to showcase the skills I have learned. In the case study, I am a Junior Analyst working for a company Cyclistic, a bike share company in Chicago. The team want to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
GOAL: Design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual memberships.

About the Company:
- 5,824 bicycles and 692 stations
- Pricing plans: Single-ride pass, Full-day pass, and annual memberships
- annual memberships are more profitable than casual memberships

The director of Marketing Moreno, provided three question to guide the future marketing program. 
**1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Moreno has assigned the first question.

I will produce a report with the following deliverables: 
1. A clear statement of the business task 
2. A description of all data sources used 
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data 
4. A summary of your analysis 
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings 
6. Your top three recommendations based on your analysis
